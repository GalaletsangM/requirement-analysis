Requiredment Analysis in Software Development

What is Requirement Analysis?
> Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecyle where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform. 

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
> 1. Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
> 2. Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
> 3. Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
> 1. Requirement Gathering : Includes interviews, Surveys/Questionnaires, Observation and Document analysis
> 2. Requiremnt Elicitation : Involves brainstorming, Prototyping and focus groups.
> 3. Requirement Documentation : Includes requirements specification document, user stories, and use cases.
> 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling : Inclodes requirement prioritixation, feasibility analysis, and modeling.
> 5. Requirement Validation :  Review and approval, acceptance criteria, and traceability.

Types of Requirements
> Functional Requirements
> > Describes What the system should.
> > Examples: User authentification, property search, booking system, user registration.
> Non-functional Requirements
> > Describes how the sytem should perform.
> > Examples: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.
